# TPA3116_Audio_Amplifier
TPA3116 Stereo and Sub-Woofer Audio Amplifier.  D-Class 50W Stereo Amplifier.  The schematic and layout are pretty much similar to the one layout in the datasheet.  Nothing too fancy, however the Subwoofer does have a summed Left and Right channel via two 470 ohm resistors `R78 R79`. The input is assumed to be a line level stereo input through a 3.5mm jack.  However, there are some through hole pins should a different connector or input be desired.  The banana plug holes on the all the speaker ouputs are for potential convenience for swapping out speakers.  Not strictly necessary, one could solder speaker cable to those through holes, or just juse the screw terminals.  The banana plugs for the power input are there for similar reasons.
